     Hi, baby. This is a "not so love letter" for you. I just want you to know that I'm glad 
<br> to have met such an amazing person such as yourself. You're so special. And when I say
<br> "you are special", I meant <u> you </u> as a whole. It's so hard to find words to describe you.

<p align="center"><font size="3" color="white">  You're already an epitome of art and a beautifully written poem all on your own. 

<p align="center"><font size="3" color="white"> I love everything about you, Ian. Even more than the world itself. I know I'm the luckiest person ever to have you.
<br> That's why you're <u> my solace. </u> You're the one that I want to be with both in good times and my worst times. 
<br> When the universe starts to tire me out, I find myself searching for you and the only thing that I want to do is
<br> run into your amrs and never let you go. You have your own way to make everything better.
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="white"> 
     So you don't have to worry about anything with us. I'll keep choosing to stay with you
<br> I'll choose you over and over again without any doubt, without any pause. 
<br> I chose to fall in love with you in  heartbeat. You'll always have me.
